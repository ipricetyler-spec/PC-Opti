# Decisions

Product decisions that shape Dialed. The detailed working log is kept privately by the owner.

- Every change Dialed makes is recorded in a local change log and can be undone from it.
- Dialed only offers changes that add to or improve user trust: each one says why, how to undo it and how to check it.
- Nothing is changed on a PC without the user choosing it; checks are read-only.
- Security is never weakened to make a tweak work.
- Dialed is built clean-room: other optimizers are judged only by what they visibly show, never by their code.
- Input-device work uses documented Windows interfaces and ships only after owner approval of the exact release.
- Dialed ships the per-machine NSIS installer, not a portable executable. A portable executable
  extracts to a predictable `%TEMP%` path while elevated, and no directory permission can secure
  that temporary extraction. The installer covers the use case with a working uninstaller and
  verified updates.
